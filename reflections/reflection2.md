## Reflection Questions

- Name at least one successful thing this week.

Implementing Profiles

- What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Implementing profiles posed some challenges and also dealing with git issues.

- Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list? (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes, we did.

- Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

We mostly researched resources as a group.

- Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

None
