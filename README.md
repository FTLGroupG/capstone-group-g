## Project Overview

- A children’s application to learn about coding, programming topics and facts. 
- Developing an immersive web application utilizing the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) stack to foster interactive learning experiences and empower kids  in mastering coding principles and concepts.

Week 4:
The goals for this week is to...

[x] create a shared Github repo for your project based on the capstone project template.

[x] brainstorm problem statements and solutions for potential capstone projects.

[x] meet your pod mentors in your first pod sync and present your initial project ideas.

[x] submit your project proposal by Friday, June 30th at 9:00pm PDT.

# Problem Statements and Solutions: 

## Problem:
Addressing the challenge of engaging kids in the process of learning coding by developing an interactive web application, built on the PERN stack, that offers a gamified learning environment, intuitive tutorials, and real-time coding practice, to instill fundamental programming skills and ignite a passion for computer science.

## Solution:
An app that teaches kids the fundamentals of programming in python in a fun, vibrant and engaging way.

## Features:
- Learning app for kids  (dragging and dropping)
- What API for the actual lesson?-
- Possibly with music in the background
- Random coding facts while paused
- Link to API
- Utilizing the FTL curriculum as a lesson plan
- Leaderboard (can be seen by registered and unregistered users) showing the profiles of different users.
Track user progress and user profiles.


## MVP:
- Login
- Registration - parent (collect child’s name, child quantity, join tables sql)
- Age group of kids (language we will use)
- Parent logs into the account, selects child to work with (profile)
- Saving progress (lowest priority core feature)
- Each lessons (5-6 sections)
- Bright colors for kids
- Javascript onDrag and onDrop event, HTML attribute isDraggable


## Stretch features:
- Leaderboard by tracking user progress

## Users Roles

- Parent
- Child
- Unauthorized User

## Users Personas
**Child:**
1. Sam is a 10-year-old elementary school student living in the San Francisco, California Bay Area. His mother works as a full-time Software Engineer remotely, so he is always able to watch her while she works. Sam is curious about how her mother creates all those amazing apps by just writing pieces of codes. Her mother has influenced Sam’s interest in learning how to code from a young age. Now Sam is determined to live by his mother’s dream.
   
2. Lola is a 7- year old student living in Orlando, Florida. Her parents have latino heritage and most of the time her family, including her, speaks in Spanish, even though she is fluent in English too. Lola has always had a sense of curiosity and a passion for science and math, so when she found out about coding through a school program for kids in STEM, she grew an interest in learning more about this field. Lola tends to get bored easily, so she would love to be able to learn about coding while having a fun interactive experience.

**Child’s Caretaker/Parent:** 
1. Carol is a full-time nanny and is employed by a married couple that wants their 7 year old child (Jamie) to learn how to code while he’s young. Carol lives in the city of Dallas and commutes to the Dallas suburbs where her clients live whenever her services are needed. Carol is 52 years old and is not very tech savvy. She will need instructions from the parents on how to use the app and get it set up for their child. 
Carol wants her clients to see her dedication in getting Jamie to learn in their absence and wants to be able to show his daily progress in an easily accessible way

2. Helen is a parent who is interested in teaching her child to code. She lives in Texas and understands that programming is a useful skill to have and needs an application that is child friendly and easy to navigate.

**Unauthorized user:**

1. Veronica is a 27-year-old mother. She works full-time as an Information Technology Specialist. Ever since she was little, she was passionate about technology and she hopes to help her daughter grow an interest in tech. She’s looking  for a  good educational app that she can use to teach her daughter how to code.

## Users Stories
1. As a parent, I want to create a profile for my child that shows lesson modules, so that there is structure to the lessons my child receives.
2. As a parent, I want a bright, colorful welcome page, so that my child is eager to learn.
3. As a parent, I want to store my child’s progress, so that all my child learns  is not lost when we login again.
4. As a child, I want to see characters/cartoons/animations, so that my attention stays fixed on the application.
5. As a parent, I want to view resources that I can skim over for a particular lesson topic, so that if my child needs extra help understanding a concept I offer an explanation.
6. As a parent, I want my child to be able to have a fun, gamified, interactive experience while trying to learn coding in an easy, fast but challenging way with a simple child-friendly interface.
7. As a child with a sibling who is also using this app, I want to be able to be in competition with my sibling so it stays interesting and fun for the both of us
8. As a parent, I would like to be able to register an account on the app and be able to have access to all of my  children’s account’s profiles.
9. As a child, I want my siblings and I to have different profiles.
10. As an unauthorized user, I want to be allowed to complete at least one lesson module before being prompted to create an account or log in, so that I can explore the application a little bit before deciding whether to create an account/log in.
11. As a child, I would like to have the option to learn in Spanish.
12. As a parent, I would like to have the option to switch between Spanish or English as the app language so that my child can use it without having to worry about using a translator.
