## Project Overview

- A children’s application to learn about coding, programming topics and facts. 
- Developing an immersive web application utilizing the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) stack to foster interactive learning experiences and empower kids  in mastering coding principles and concepts.

Week 4:
The goals for this week is to...

[x] create a shared Github repo for your project based on the capstone project template.

[x] brainstorm problem statements and solutions for potential capstone projects.

[x] meet your pod mentors in your first pod sync and present your initial project ideas.

[x] submit your project proposal by Friday, June 30th at 9:00pm PDT.

# Problem Statements and Solutions: 

## Problem:
Addressing the challenge of engaging kids in the process of learning coding by developing an interactive web application, built on the PERN stack, that offers a gamified learning environment, intuitive tutorials, and real-time coding practice, to instill fundamental programming skills and ignite a passion for computer science.

## Solution:
An app that teaches kids the fundamentals of programming in python in a fun, vibrant and engaging way.

## Features:
- Learning app for kids  (dragging and dropping)
- What API for the actual lesson?-
- Possibly with music in the background
- Random coding facts while paused
- Link to API
- Utilizing the FTL curriculum as a lesson plan
- Leaderboard (can be seen by registered and unregistered users) showing the profiles of different users.
Track user progress and user profiles.


## MVP:
- Login
- Registration - parent (collect child’s name, child quantity, join tables sql)
- Age group of kids (language we will use)
- Parent logs into the account, selects child to work with (profile)
- Saving progress (lowest priority core feature)
- Each lessons (5-6 sections)
- Bright colors for kids
- Javascript onDrag and onDrop event, HTML attribute isDraggable


## Stretch features:
- Leaderboard by tracking user progress
